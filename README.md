### Tech used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Optimizations:
This site has been optimized for both mobile and desktop performance, as well as accessibility, general best practices, and SEO. Performance gains were made through progressive rendering techniques and proper image sizing. Additional performance gains could be made through the elimination of render-blocking, non-critical CSS. Accessibility could be further improved with a change in color palette, providing for a higher contrast ratio between background and foreground colors.
